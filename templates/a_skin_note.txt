Are you a developer?

Creating a template/skin (both are synonymous) can't be any easier.

=====

When creating a new skin, ensure the skin meets the following criteria:

* The following comment is pasted at the top of the skin:
/*
Variables $title, $body, and $html_buttons come from skin-variables.php.
These variables have been safely escaped from that file.
*/

* include(USP_BASE_DIR . 'templates/skin-variables.php'); is at the top of the php file.
* Heading (h1,h2,etc..) has class 'usp-form-title-text' (this is used for realtime text listener).
  - Inside should be esc_html($title)
* Body has class 'usp-form-body-text' (this is used for realtime text listener).
  - Inside should be esc_html($body)
* These are non-existant CSS classes and it should stay that way. It's used as an identifier for jQuery.
* the <form> has <?php if (isset($fake_form) && ($fake_form === true)) echo ' onsubmit="return false"'; ?> attached to the properties.
* No hardcoded login buttons. Instead, a div with class="usp-form-submit".
  - Inside the div, buttons will added thru "echo usp_sanitize_html_button_payload($html_buttons);"

Then to configure ajax submissions:
* Form action should be toward <?php echo admin_url('admin-ajax.php');?> (incase javascript/ajax is disabled)
* Form should have the class "usp-form-js"
* Inside, put <?php if ($fake_form === false) { wp_nonce_field( 'usp_submit_new_subscriber_nonce', 'usp_nonce' ); } ?>
* A required input with name="usp_email" (subscriber email)
* A required input with name="usp_name" (subscriber name)
* Any text such as <p> or <h3> with style="display: none" and class="usp-submission-response"
  - this tells the user the result of the subscription.

====

Also:

You get access to the following variables:
* $title - user-defined title of form
* $body - user-defined body of form
* usp_sanitize_html_button_payload($html_buttons) - html of submit buttons. No need to loop or anything. These buttons must be in the class "usp-form-submit" though.
* $is_popup - bool whether or not it's a popup form.
* $fake_form - bool whether this is being shown in the admin "Create Form" section
* USP_BASE_DIR - root plugin directory
* USP_BASE_URL - base url of the plugin directory.

Finally, to register the skin, go to /views/RegisteredSkins.php.
