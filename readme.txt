====== Details ======

Ultimate Subscribe Pro is an all-in-one email system for managing subscribers.
In essence, you can create subscription forms that visitors may see.
When a user subscribes, their information is stored into the database, and you can send emails to them.


====== Installation ======
This plugin is installed just like other WordPress plugins.
1) Extract this ZIP file if you haven't already.
2) Move the folder "UltimateSubscribePro" into your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.
3) Activate the plugin "Ultimate Subscribe Pro" on the "Plugins" menu on the left side panel.

===== Form Creation ======
Subscription Forms can be set up relatively quickly.
1) Navigate to the plugin menu on the left side, labeled "SubscribePro"
2) Go to "Categories" submenu. On the top, click "Create Category".
    Subscribers are grouped by "Categories". You can name your category to anything like "Daily Deals", "Doorbuster Deals",
    or whichever. Category names are only known to administrators.
3) Visit the "Create Form" submenu. Fill out the fields and follow instructions.
4) When you are done, click "Create Form."
5) If everything went alright, you will be sent to the "View Forms" submenu.
    Look for the row on the table representing the form you just created.
6) Look for the form's shortcode. Copy that shortcode, and paste it into the page that you wish to have the form on.
7) Profit! Every time a visitor subscribes, they'll be added to the Category you created in step 2.

===== Email Setup ======
You may send emails by:
A) Exporting a CSV file containing all your subscribers names and emails, and using it with your own email client.
B) Using the built in mail client.

To export a CSV file:
1) Visit the "Categories" submenu, look for your category.
2) Look for your category row, and hit "Export to CSV".

Using the built in mail client:
1) Visit email settings submenu
2) Fill in SMTP settings.
    If you are a beginner, it may be best to use a gmail account for this.
    Simply select your SMTP profile as "Gmail", and enter in your username & password for Gmail. Press save.
3) Visit "Send Emails" submenu, and enter required details in there.
4) Press send when you are done!
5) If your emails are getting sent to spam, visit the "Help" submenu. There is a lot of support there.
